To test the Script functionality, with these scripts, delete (for most of them this is required, unless you change values) all data 
using:
deleteAllTableContent.sql in the script folder.

Make sure 'makeTestUser' is set to true, in web.xml to create a admin-user to get started (AND DON'T FORGET TO REMOVE BEFORE DEPLOYMENT)
